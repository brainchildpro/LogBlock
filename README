This is a fork of LogBlock; coded solely by Ruan.

Package name is kept for the sake of other plugins using the API.

Changes from the original LogBlock:

* Merge Questioner into LogBlock; no need for a seperate 'API' which is just a thread that already pauses when asking; no point in having multiple plugins access it

* Add 'DropQueueAfter' setting, which dumps the queue to files if it exceeds a certain size(Was originally killConnectionAfter but killing the connection caused memory leaks, so this came to mind)

* Fixed Chest API; chest logging isn't duplicated and many players can access a chest
  at once without any issues

* Plugin continues to run even if the DB could not be connected on startup. It will keep trying to
  reconnect, and it will dump its queue to files while it can't.

* Some messages are different and more user-friendly.

* Aliases for commands, 'lb sq' for savequeue and 'lb qs' for queuesize

* Rollbacks now silently save the queue, and only inform the user if an error occurs

* New command 'lb ssq' to silently save the queue, and 
  'lb killconnection' to kill the MySQL connection and attempt to reconnect

* When the connection is unavailable, it will not spam the console as much as it did before.
  The disconnection message is throttled to send only once per minute. ('MySQL connection lost')

* There is a permission for players to be allowed to drop LogBlock tools. (logblock.dropTools)

* Log rollbacks and redos into 'plugins/LogBlock/lb.log'

Original description:

This plugin logs block creates and destroys to a MySQL database. It can be used as an anti-griefing tool to find out who made a particular edit, or even roll back changes by certain players.
Originally written by bootswithdefer for hMod ported to Bukkit by me, because of impossibleness to identfy griefers. Due to BigBrother also did't work, I was forced to do it myself. The honor belongs to bootswithdefer for the sourcecode, I only spended nearly 8 hours to transcribe. All functions except sign text logging shold work as in hMod. The use of permissions plugin is possible, but not necessary.
