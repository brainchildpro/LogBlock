This plugin logs block creates and destroys to a MySQL database. It can be used as an anti-griefing tool to find out who made a particular edit, or even roll back changes by certain players.
Originally written by bootswithdefer for hMod ported to Bukkit by me, because of impossibleness to identfy griefers. Due to BigBrother also did't work, I was forced to do it myself. The honor belongs to bootswithdefer for the sourcecode, I only spended nearly 8 hours to transcribe. All functions except sign text logging shold work as in hMod. The use of permissions plugin is possible, but not necessary.
